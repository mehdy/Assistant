# Assistant

Assistant is a configurable and pluginable software to automate jobs.
Similiar softwares are IFTTT and Zapyer. But the main difference is that
those tools are built for end-users with no programming knowledge so they're pretty simple and limited.
However Assistant is a highly complicated software built for programmers to create complex routines and mechanisms.
